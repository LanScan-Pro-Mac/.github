## What is LanScan?  

**LanScan** is a lightweight and efficient **network scanner for macOS** that allows users to detect all active devices connected to their local network. Whether you‚Äôre managing a home Wi-Fi setup, troubleshooting connectivity issues, or analyzing enterprise networks, LanScan provides fast and accurate discovery of every IP and MAC address on the network.  

Developed to be intuitive yet powerful, LanScan performs automatic subnet detection and identifies devices across multiple interfaces. It lists **IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames, and vendor information**, making it a must-have tool for network administrators, IT specialists, and tech-savvy users.  

LanScan can scan both **wired and wireless networks**, identifying all reachable devices even in complex topologies. With its **real-time scanning engine**, it updates the list dynamically as devices connect or disconnect. You can export results for documentation or audits, and use filters to focus on specific hosts or device types.  

Built for performance and accuracy, LanScan operates natively on **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)** and supports the latest versions of macOS. It‚Äôs a simple yet professional-grade network analysis tool that delivers clarity, control, and insight into your network environment.
